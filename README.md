<h3 align="left">Motivation </h3>
 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> Home Vehicle parking system is one of the most important factors to reduce traffic and satisfy drivers. Moreover, when parking the vehicles in the apartment parking place, the driver has to open the door. So, the driver has to get out of the vehicle and open it.So the project objective is to develop a system to allow authorised vehicles in the particular apartment. Also, we used computer vision techniques and a Raspberry-Pi camera module and an ultrasonic sensor in order to make this system.</p>

<h2 align="center"> Technologies Used </h2>
 
 ```
 1. IDE - Pycharm
 2. SSD - Mobilenet - As a object detection model
 3. GPU - P-4000
 4. Google Colab - image alaysis
 5. OCR - Extract the numplerplate information
 6. OpenCV - Draw the bounding boxes
 7. RaspberryPi 4 - Run the program as a computer
 8. Joy-pi - Monitoting system
 9. Ultrasonic sensor - If any object detect by sensor and finding distance of the object from the sensor
10. Servo Motor - handling the door
11. MQTT - As a communication Protocol
 
 ```
  
<h3 align="left"> Project Limitations </h3>

 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> * Three wheels were used instead of four wheels. To build a three-wheel Car, three-wheeled was to have a mounting where the third wheel could be assembled. This mount is designed based on the space available on the model car. To provide the steering, a servo motor must be fitted so that the mounting used for the steering wheel could be extended for mounting the servo motor.</p>
