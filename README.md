<h3 align="left">Motivation </h3>
 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> Home Vehicle parking system is one of the most important factors to reduce traffic and satisfy drivers. Moreover, when parking the vehicles in the apartment parking place, the driver has to open the door. So, the driver has to get out of the vehicle and open it.So the project objective is to develop a system to allow authorised vehicles in the particular apartment. Also, we used **computer vision** techniques and a **Raspberry-Pi camera** module and an **ultrasonic sensor** in order to make this system.</p>


<h2 align="center"> Technologies Used </h2>
 
 ```
 1. IDE - Pycharm
 2. SSD - Mobilenet - As a object detection model
 3. GPU - P-4000
 4. Google Colab - image alaysis
 5. OCR - Extract the numplerplate information
 6. OpenCV - Draw the bounding boxes
 7. RaspberryPi 4 - Run the program as a computer
 8. Joy-pi - Monitoting system
 9. Ultrasonic sensor - If any object detect by sensor and finding distance of the object from the sensor
10. Servo Motor - handling the door
11. MQTT - As a communication Protocol
 
 ```
  
<h3 align="left"> Project Limitations </h3>

 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> 
 
1.	Toy cars only used as vehicles
 
2.	**Two different cars** were used to demonstrate the project
 
3.	Just used **250 images** for each category to train the model
 
4.	Instead of the number plate, Pre-Defied number plate information was printed on white the paper
 
5.	The toy car was moved manually
